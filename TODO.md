# Development ToDo List

- [ ] filter on product names in `RlmProductMetrics.update_metrics()` should not
  be hard coded
- [ ] report parsing status (errors) and timings (request, parsing, ...)
- [ ] mention RLM memory leak and suggested workaround by restarting the service
  through a scheduled task (provide an example PowerShell script)
